# Awk course FAQ

## What is the goal of this repository?

The goal of this repository is to use the 'To Awk Or Not?' materials
and put it into lesson plans. 

## Why is the course on 'To Awk Or Not?'

This repository is based on the material of <https://pmitev.github.io/to-awk-or-not/>,
because it is -as far as I can see- the only free and online Awl
resource that has both text and exercises.

## Why not use the 'To Awk Or Not?' repository for these lessons?

That repository does not allow `mermaid` plots.
I will not change the setup of the 'To Awk Or Not?' repository.
Hence, I needed another repository :-) 

## Why is this a Fork from the UPPMAX repository?

Because the current owner does not have all 
the access rights to work on that repository.
